# ARIMA vs Machine Learning Models: Forecasting NGX Stock Prices

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and forecasting project that compares **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** models with modern **machine learning techniques** for predicting stock prices of companies listed on the **Nigerian Exchange (NGX)**.  

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional time series models versus machine learning approaches in capturing stock price trends, patterns, and volatility over time.

## ‚ö° Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting time series data.  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots and descriptive statistics.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - **ARIMA**: Captures autocorrelation, trends, and seasonality.  
   - **Machine Learning Models**:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
     - (Other models can be added for extension)  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R¬≤ Score  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Actual vs Predicted stock price trends.  
   - Residual analysis.  
   - Model comparison plots.

## üöÄ Key Findings

- ARIMA models are effective for capturing short-term dependencies but may struggle with nonlinear relationships.  
- Machine learning models provide flexibility and can capture complex patterns, but they often require more tuning and larger datasets.  
- Combining both approaches may yield improved forecasting performance.
